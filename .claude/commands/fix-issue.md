# Fix issue: $ARGUMENTS

1. **Understand.** If the argument is an issue number, run `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --comments`. If `gh` is unavailable, ask me to paste the issue. Restate expected vs actual behaviour and how to reproduce it.
2. **Locate.** Find the code path; use the Explore subagent for broad searches. Read the PRD feature it belongs to and the ARCHITECTURE boundaries it touches.
3. **Plan.** List the files you expect to change. More than five, or anything in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §08 (new dependency, table, service, auth or payment change): stop and ask, with options and a recommendation.
4. **Branch.** On main, create `fix/<issue-number>-<short-slug>`. Ask first if there are uncommitted changes.
5. **Reproduce first.** Write a failing test at the lowest sensible level: a service unit test first, e2e only for a broken critical flow. Run it and confirm it fails for the reason from step 1.
6. **Fix.** The smallest change that makes the test pass, following AGENTS.md and the rules. No drive-by refactors.
7. **Verify.** Run the new test, the related suite, lint and typecheck. For UI changes, check 375px.
8. **Report.** Root cause in one or two sentences, the fix, the tests added, what you did not do, what I should check. Suggest a commit message: `fix(<scope>): <summary>` and `Fixes #<n>`. Do not commit or push unless I ask.
